# Gender Inequality

A sizeable body of evidence suggests that reduction in gender inequality has been stagnant in the United States (e.g. Blau and Kahn 2007). Is this trend US specific, or global? We use data from the OECD, UN, and BLS to examine the trends in various measures of gender inequality.

# Visualization
<li>The Choropleth presents the gender wage gap by percentile. The dropdown menu on the left allows you to choose the level of percentiles: 10th, 50th and 90th. You can also drag the date slider to view data at different points or click Play to see the date change automatically.</li>

<li>The dumbell plots is displayed with a Shiny App. You can choose a sector (Employment, Education, Entrepreneurship) with the radio button. Below, the dropdown menu will filter the categories included in the sector chosen. When choosing a category, the dumbell plot displays the value for the women (red) and men (blue) for each country of the year selected. It automatically orders the countries by decreasing order of the absolute value of the gender inequality gaps and filter for missing values for each year. You can also drag the date slider to view data at different points or click Play to see the date change automatically.</li>

<li>GII dsiplays the Gender Inequality Index from the Human Development Report for a selection of countries using Plotly. You can hover over the points to view a tooltip showing the Year, the Country and the GII value. </li>

<li>GPD_per_Capita_and_Wage_Gap is a shiny app showing the Gender inequalities by level of GPD (Gross Domestic Product) and by gender wage gap percentile. You can choose the level of percentile in the dropdown menu and the income level with the checkbox.</li>

<li>US_gender_wage_gap_by_age dsiplays the ratio of female-to-male median earnings by age in the US using Plotly. You can hover over the points to view a tooltip showing the Year, the Country and the ratio value. </li>


# Conclusions

<li> In most countries, the levels of gender inequality in employment, self-employment, and academic performance are still extreme.  The only measure in which women are at least equal to men is enrollment in tertiary institutions. </li>

<li>Gender wage gaps are generally converging, especially among countries with high GDP per capita, with the exception of the United States.</li>

<li>Wage gaps tend to remain in middle income countries and there is no generalized pattern among low income countries.</li> 

<li>The GII implies that gender inequality is improving, but at a slow rate.</li>  

<li>The US female earnings at young age are comparable to male's, however decreases as age increases.</li>
